[00:34.15] I will always love you
[00:38.69] How I do
[00:42.64] Let go of a prayer for you
[00:47.11] Just a sweet word
[00:51.17] The table is prepared for you
[01:05.67] 
[01:08.73] Wishing you godspeed, glory
[01:14.32] There will be mountains you won't move
[01:33.32] 
[01:25.74] Still, I'll always be there for you
[01:30.66] How I do
[01:34.66] 
[01:34.77] I let go of my claim on you, it's a free world
[01:43.09] You look down on where you came from sometimes
[02:06.09] 
[01:52.48] But you'll have this place to call home, always
[02:15.98] 
[02:04.32] This love will keep us through blinding of the eyes (oh)
[02:08.13] Silence in the ears, darkness of the mind (until it's time)
[02:12.79] This love will keep us through blinding of the eyes (oh, oh-oh)
[02:16.18] Silence in the ears, darkness of the mind (oh, oh-oh, oh)
[02:20.80] This love will keep us through blinding of the eyes (oh, until it's time we die)
[02:24.40] Silence in the ears, darkness of the mind
[02:44.90] 
[02:30.56] Hmm-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh
[02:40.56] 
[02:39.73] I'll always love you until the time we die
[03:00.73] 
[02:48.86] Oh-oh, hmm
