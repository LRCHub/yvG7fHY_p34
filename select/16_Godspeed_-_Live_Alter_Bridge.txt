Test me once again
You know I didn't do anything
Set my life on low
You know I could have had it all
Drifting out of place
With no direction and no escape
Set out all alone
Oh to a place I don't belong

Without you
I know that I must change
Without you
I'll never be the same
No

Farewell
Godspeed
And goodbye
You have lived
And you have changed
All our lives

Test me all the way
Surely you know
I'm not afraid
Prove now once again
That I will never see the end

Without you
I know that I must change
Without you
I'll never be the same

Farewell
Godspeed
And goodbye
You have lived
And you have changed
All our lives

Cast away
Our regrets and all our fears
Just like
Like you did when you were here

And then the days
They ran out
And then the days
They ran out

Farewell
Godspeed
And goodbye
You have lived
And you have changed
All our lives

Cast away
Our regrets and all our fears
Just like
Like you did when you were here

And then the days
They ran out
And then the days
They ran out
